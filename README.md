## Project Overview

This project utilizes historical stock data to predict future stock prices using machine learning algorithms. The repository includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation scripts.

## Features 
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
- Evaluating different regression models for stock price prediction
- Data fetching from Yahoo Finance
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual stock

## List of Python Codes in this project (in reverse cronological order):
- Excel data clean-up and summarization using Pivot Table in the code
- Python program to take an Excel file for Product Sales, clean it up for blanks, NaNs and non-logical values and write the file with Sales and Average Price summaries
- Updated clustering into three categories of 'Low', 'Medium' and 'High' along with summary statistics of these categories
- Clustering of Historical Inflation data using K-Means from Scikit-learn
- Updated the forecasting model to use RandomForest algorithm
- Simple Program to forecast MSFT stock price using linear regression machine learning model
