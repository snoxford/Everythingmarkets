## Project Overview

This project utilizes historical stock data to predict future stock prices using machine learning algorithms. The repository includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation scripts.

## Features 
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
- Evaluating different regression models for stock price prediction
- Data fetching from Yahoo Finance
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual stock

## List of Python Codes in this project:
3- Clustering of Histoical Inflation data using K-Means from Scikit-learn
2- Updated the forecasting model to use RandomForest algorithm
1- Simple Program to forecast MSFT stock price using linear regression machine learning model

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-prediction.git
