## Project Overview

This project utilizes historical stock data to predict future stock prices using machine learning algorithms. The repository includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation scripts.

## Features 
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
- Evaluating different regression models for stock price prediction
- Data fetching from Yahoo Finance
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual stock

## List of Python Codes in this project (in reverse cronological order):
- Updated MSFT price prediction code to use RandomForest machine learning prediction model
- Updated Polynomial Regression code to split the data into training and test data
- Program to run polynomial regression from Scikit-learn to determine Price of Diamonds using Length, Width and Depth
- A simple code to invoke OpenAI LangChain and use it to tell a short story
- Code to read a sql database stored locally and run some sql queries to update the contents in the database
- A simple program to transfer Excel data to an SQL database stored locally 
- The code to update the price of NVDA from YFinance to chart Protective Put and Covered Call strategy after Earnings
- Before NVDA earnings call today 11/20/24, the code is used to chart covered Call and protective Put trading strategy 
- This code will give sentiment analysis for content related to US from FT.com
- A new code is added to generate a word cloud of the summary generated from FT.com
- Simple code to retrieve and summarize a webpage (not a LLM based code)
- Excel data clean-up and summarization using Pivot Table in the code
- Python program to take an Excel file for Product Sales, clean it up for blanks, NaNs and non-logical values and write the file with Sales and Average Price summaries
- Updated clustering into three categories of 'Low', 'Medium' and 'High' along with summary statistics of these categories
- Clustering of Historical Inflation data using K-Means from Scikit-learn
- Updated the forecasting model to use RandomForest algorithm
- A program to find the lag between Advertising spend and Realized Sales. The lag is determined by maximizing R-squared in simple OLS/linear regression
- Simple Program to forecast MSFT stock price using linear regression machine learning model
